# Credit-Card-Financial-Dashboard
Develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

Using Power BI, I created two dynamic dashboards:
## 1  Credit Card Transaction Analysis: 
This dashboard dives deep into transactional data, providing insights on total revenue, interest, quarterly revenue trends, and week-on-week growth.

## 2 Credit Card Customer Report: 
 Focused on customer demographics, this dashboard allows you to explore customer data filtered by gender. From age distribution to income analysis, it offers valuable insights into customer behavior.

 ## Insights from the REPORT:
• Revenue increased by 28.8%.

• Total interest is 8M.

• Total transaction amount is 46M.

• Male customers are contributing more in revenue 31M, females 26M.

• Blue & Silver credit cards are contributing to 93% of overall transactions.

• TX, NY & CA are contributing to 68%.

• Overall Activation rate is 57.5%.

• Overall Delinquent rate is 6.06%.
